# 🚴‍♂️ Ride the Future with the RAG Bike Chatbot Application! 🚴‍♀️✨
Welcome to the **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Application**, your personal chatbot designed to help you explore the wonderful world of bikes! By integrating PDF files that detail bike features into Snowflake, we’ve built a smart application that not only fetches information but also fine-tunes itself to provide you with precise answers. Let's get ready to cycle through knowledge like never before!
## 🌟 What is this Application?
This innovative application leverages the power of **Snowflake** and **Streamlit** to provide an interactive chatbot experience. By using PDF files containing important bike information as context, our RAG model delivers insights, answers your queries, and remembers your chat history, ensuring a seamless dialogue. 
### Key Features:
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Ask anything about bikes, and our chatbot will provide accurate, real-time responses based on the latest data.
- **Contextual Understanding**: The underlying Snowflake framework utilizes intricate bike-related PDF documents to enhance the chatbot's answers, giving you the context you need.
- **Chat History Memory**: The chatbot remembers your previous interactions, making the conversation flow more natural and engaging.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Streamlit**, our application presents an intuitive interface that makes searching for bike information a breeze.
## 🏗️ How It Works
1. **Data Ingestion**: The PDF files about bikes and their features are uploaded to Snowflake, where they serve as a rich source of contextual data for the model.
2. **Fine-Tuning**: The chatbot utilizes this data to fine-tune its understanding, ensuring you receive relevant and accurate information tailored to your queries.
3. **User Interaction**: Through a sleek **Streamlit** frontend, users can ask questions about bikes, and the chatbot responds in real-time, leveraging its trained knowledge.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Each chat session not only retains the context of your conversation but also helps further refine the chatbot's responses over time.
