# ⚙️ Fine-tuning for Enterprise Use-Cases with Snowflake Cortex AI

Welcome to the **Fine-tuning for Enterprise Use-Cases** quickstart guide! 
In this guide, we'll explore how organizations can leverage the power of Snowflake Cortex AI to fine-tune large language models, achieving high accuracy in support ticket categorization while significantly reducing inference costs.

## 🌟 Why Fine-tuning?
While larger foundational models like Mistral-Large deliver impressive performance, they come with substantial costs. Fine-tuning allows organizations to make smaller models exceptionally effective at specific tasks—delivering results comparable to those of larger models but at a fraction of the cost.

## 📚 What You Will Learn
By the end of this quickstart guide, you will be able to use **Snowflake Cortex AI** to:
- **Categorize**: Use LLM to effectively categorize support tickets.
- **Generate**: Prepare a training dataset for fine-tuning by leveraging an LLM for annotations.
- **Fine-tune**: Apply a smaller, fine-tuned model to achieve accuracy similar to that of larger models at reduced costs.
- **Generate**: Craft custom email/text communications tailored specifically to each support ticket.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have:
- A **Snowflake account** in a region where Snowflake Cortex is available. [Check availability here](https://www.snowflake.com/).

- A Snowflake user created with **ACCOUNTADMIN** permissions. This user will be used to get things set up in Snowflake.

- Download the Snowflake Notebook from this Git repository for fine-tuning the model.
 
## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tusharr08/Snowflake-Cortex.git
2. Set Up Your Snowflake Environment: Ensure your Snowflake account and user permissions are configured properly. 3. Follow the Notebook Instructions: Open the Snowflake Notebook you downloaded and follow the step-by-step instructions to fine-tune your model.
