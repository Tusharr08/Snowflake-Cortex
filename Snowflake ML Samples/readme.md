# ðŸš€ Dive into the Future of Data with **ML Functions**! ðŸ“Šâœ¨
Welcome to a world where your data transforms into actionable insights without the need for a PhD in machine learning! With **Snowflake's ML Functions**, all you need is your data, and weâ€™ll handle the heavy lifting. Get ready to unlock automated predictions and drive your business decisions forward!
## ðŸ§  What are ML Functions?
**ML Functions** empower you to leverage advanced machine learning capabilities right within your Snowflake environment. Designed for users of all expertise levels, these functions automatically create and utilize appropriate models tailored to your specific data type. Say goodbye to complexity and hello to insight!
### ðŸŒŸ Key Features
1. **Time-Series Functions**  
   Perfect for analyzing metrics that evolve over time. These features allow you to train models on time-series data to reveal patterns and make predictions.
   - **Forecasting**: Anticipate future values of metrics (like sales) based on historical trends. Predicting tomorrowâ€™s success has never been easier!
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual metric values that deviate from expected behavior, ensuring you catch surprises before they become problems.
   - **Contribution Explorer**: Uncover surprising elements that influence your key metrics. Discover what really drives performance!
2. **Other Analysis Functions**  
   Not all data tells a time-based story. For more static analyses, our other functions shine:
   - **Classification**: Efficiently categorize your data into distinct classes based on predictive features, providing clarity and actionable insights.
### ðŸ’° Cost Considerations
While harnessing the power of ML Functions, itâ€™s essential to be aware of associated costs:
- **Storage Costs**: Each time you train a model, it will create model instances that incur storage fees. To keep your costs in check, remember to manage and delete unused or obsolete models. 
- **Compute Costs**: Calculating models and making predictions come with compute charges. Explore [Understanding Compute Costs](#) for detailed information on costs associated with Snowflake compute usage.
You can monitor your storage and compute costs through the **Account Usage Views** in Snowflake:
- **ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES**
- **ACCOUNT_USAGE.STAGES**
## ðŸŒˆ Why Choose Snowflake's ML Functions?
